                  This was a really fun group project, using API's to get location services and park/trail information. The premise was to allow users search ability based on location. The map would then update and highlight available parks and trails in the desired area.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, and thank you for taking the time to visit my Portfolio. I spent most of my working life doing construction, but after researching coding and finding the world interesting I decided to make a career change and pursue it full time. I'm very new, and words can't express the amount I don't know. I do feel overwhelmed at times, but mostly I am very grateful to have this opportunity and fascinated with the subject matter.
