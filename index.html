                  This was a really fun group project, using API's to get location services and park/trail information. The premise was to allow users search ability based on location. The map would then update and highlight available parks and trails in the desired area.

                  This was another group project, essentially a variation on support blogs. We wanted to create something that was more accessible for people that are not tech savvy. A user can add, delete, and comment on posts once they have registered. Some newer features we added are chart.js to see what articles are most highly populated on our site. I added a modal recently and I want to use chart js to hold votes for users if they would like to see a certain topic covered more.

                  This was my favorite homework assignment in the bootcamp. I really like inquirer and personally find it slightly irritating to waste time on repetitive elements of creating a read me. This one is a link to a video on youtube explaining what I did.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, and thank you for taking the time to visit my Portfolio. I spent most of my working life doing construction, but after researching coding and finding the world interesting I decided to make a career change and pursue it full time. I'm very new, and words can't express the amount I don't know. I do feel overwhelmed at times, but mostly I am very grateful to have this opportunity and fascinated with the subject matter.
